## From SAS to Python

All of these previous analyses were done in SAS. I transitioned them over to Python to practice the language.

Jupyter:

- Lab1: Exploratory data analysis on loans
- Lab2: Hypothesis testing and regression analysis on loans
- Lab3: Hypothesis testing on Canadian NHPI 
- Lab4: Hypothesis testing and regression analysis on Canadian NHPI
- Lab5: Logistic regression analysis on admission estimation to Business or Law School
- Lab6: After-tax income detrending
- Lab7: ARIMA on Composite HPI
- Lab8: First differenced bond regression with ARIMA residuals

SAS transferred:

- Lab3: Hypothesis testing on Canadian NHPI 
- Lab4: Hypothesis testing and regression analysis on Canadian NHPI
